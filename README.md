# MSc.Thesis-RNA-Editing-and-CVDs

Collection of scripts used in the MSc. thesis project. This project is divided in two parts. In the first part different RNA editing detection tools (RED-ML, SPRINT, REDItools2, JACUSA2 and BCFtools) were used to analysed a RNA-seq data to assess their performance. In the second part REDItools2 was used to analysed RNA-seq to study the relationship between Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
